Big Idea: Analyze public records to identify congressional voting bloks

Preparation for Cluster Analisis of Voting Blocks
=================================================

# defaultdict for accumalating data (tabulating)
# defaultdict for reversing a one-to-many mapping
# glob
# reading files with an encoding
# using next() or islice() to remove elements from an iterator
# csv reader
# tuple unpacking
# looping idioms: enumarate, zip, reversed, sorted, set
# incrementing instances of Counter
# assertions

Application to Congresional Voting Dataset
=================================================

# Accumulate votting record for each U.S. Senator for the 114th Congress.
# Use k-means to identify clusters of like voters
# Display the cluster and their actual party affilations

Discuss Benefit and Weaknesses of K-menas
=================================================

# Ideally, the votes should be weighted by importance
# What is the proper way to handle non-votes?
# How are results blased by only including bills that passed?
# Method assumes patterns / affiliations do not change over time
# Binary vectors give many equidistance paths
